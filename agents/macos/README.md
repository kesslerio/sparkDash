# sparkDash Mac node agent

A small collector that turns an Apple Silicon Mac into a sparkDash node: system
vitals plus an honest picture of which local model runtime, if any, is serving.

- **stdlib only.** Runs on the system `python3`. `psutil` is used when present
  (per-core CPU detail) and never required, so there is nothing to `pip install`.
- **Nothing invented.** GPU busy-ness and GPU/CPU/ANE power
  need `powermetrics`, which requires root. An ordinary user keeps CPU and GPU
  temperature null, with the reason, and still reports thermal pressure from
  `pmset -g therm` (nominal, slow, trapped, or unknown, plus the last recorded
  event lines). A root LaunchDaemon can publish real die temperatures in
  celsius. Without a reading the dashboard renders "unavailable" instead of a
  convincing zero.
- **Nothing hardcoded about the engines.** Which runtimes exist, their ports, how
  to recognise them, and how to read the served model out of argv all come from
  [`runtimes.json`](runtimes.json). A Python server that is not in the inventory
  shows up as `other-runtime` with its own command basename rather than being
  folded into an engine it merely resembles.

## Run it

```bash
python3 agents/macos/sparkdash_mac_agent.py --once --pretty   # one snapshot to stdout
python3 agents/macos/sparkdash_mac_agent.py --serve --port 8790   # HTTP: /metrics, /health
python3 agents/macos/sparkdash_mac_agent.py --once --config my-runtimes.json
```

`GET /metrics` returns the snapshot; `GET /health` is a cheap liveness answer.
Samples are shared for two seconds (`SAMPLE_TTL_S`) so a fast poll loop costs one
`iostat` + one `lsof`, not one per request.
While the first sample is pending, `/metrics` returns HTTP 503 without telemetry.
A slow refresh retains one worker and publishes its result when it finishes;
previous samples include `sampleAgeSeconds` and `sampleStale`.

## Install as a LaunchAgent (one line)

```bash
sed "s|/Users/PLACEHOLDER|$HOME|g; s|REPOS/sparkDash|$(pwd)|" agents/macos/ai.onyx.sparkdash-mac-agent.plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.onyx.sparkdash-mac-agent.plist && launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.onyx.sparkdash-mac-agent.plist
```

Run from the sparkDash checkout, after editing the plist's `--host`/`--port` if
the defaults (bind all interfaces, port 8790 — no credentials, so keep it on a
trusted LAN or tailnet) are wrong for you. Then add the unit in sparkDash with
**Unit type → Apple Silicon Mac** and a **Mac node agent** port of 8790.

Stop it with `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/ai.onyx.sparkdash-mac-agent`.

### Unlocking GPU and ANE power

Run the agent as root and it samples `powermetrics` itself. The opt-in
LaunchDaemon below does that. Until then `gpu.utilization`, `gpu.power` and
`ane.power` stay declared-unavailable, which is what the dashboard is built to
show. `--powermetrics` still attempts `sudo -n powermetrics` from a user
process for those power counters only; it does not publish temperatures.

### Opt-in root temperatures

Installing the privileged collector is a deliberate step. It is not started by
the user-agent install, and that install is left untouched.

```bash
agents/macos/install-privileged-collector.sh
agents/macos/uninstall-privileged-collector.sh
```

An ordinary user runs either command. `sudo` prompts to copy the LaunchDaemon
plist to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and to bootstrap or bootout
`ai.onyx.sparkdash-mac-agent.privileged`. The user LaunchAgent
(`ai.onyx.sparkdash-mac-agent`, port 8790) is not modified, stopped, or
replaced. The daemon listens on `127.0.0.1:8791` so the install does not open
another LAN port. Point the sparkDash Mac node agent port at 8791 to read
temperatures. Edit the installed plist's `--host` only if a remote dashboard
must scrape it; that is the same unauthenticated `/metrics` trust model as the
user agent.

Installation copies only `sparkdash_mac_agent.py` and `runtimes.json` into
`/Library/Application Support/ai.onyx.sparkdash-mac-agent`, owned by root:wheel
and writable only by root. It refuses unprotected or symlinked parent
directories. The daemon uses isolated Python imports and runs the protected
copy, so checkout edits require another authorized installation to take effect.
Elevated runtime detection remains limited to the console user's processes;
without a console user it reports no runtimes. Agent processes are excluded.

Security: the daemon runs as root so it can read hardware counters. It reads
`powermetrics` text and, when that text has no die-temperature lines (Apple
Silicon `powermetrics` does not print them), AppleSMC temperature keys
(`Tp`/`Te`/`Ts` for CPU, `Tg` for GPU). It does not write hardware state and
does not add a network service beyond the agent's existing read-only metrics
listener. Every external command the agent runs has a hard timeout, so one
stuck probe cannot wedge `/metrics`.

## Runtime inventory

`runtimes.json` is a list of entries, evaluated top to bottom, first match wins —
so a model-specific variant (`splash-35b`) is listed before its catch-all parent
(`splash`). Each entry may use:

| key           | meaning                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | reported runtime name                                                    |
| `label`       | display label (defaults to `name`)                                       |
| `ports`       | listener ports the engine is expected to own; no match → not reported    |
| `exe`         | regex against the process command basename and, for interpreters, the script being run |
| `argvAll`     | regexes that must all match the full command line                        |
| `role`        | `server` (default) or `watchdog` (a launcher: reported as `running`)     |
| `health`      | `{path, timeoutMs}` GET on loopback that proves "serving" (default `/v1/models`) |
| `model`       | `{flags, positional}` — how to read the served model out of argv         |

Anything matched by an entry is claimed by it. Every remaining TCP listener owned
by a Python-ish process is reported once as `other-runtime`.

The shipped file is seeded from the captain's `model-start()` shell functions
(`omlx`, `qflash`, `splash` + `-27b`/`-35b`, `ds4`, `ds4-serve`, `mtplx` +
`-27b`/`-35b`/`-flash`, the `:8200` MTPLX mux, and `tensorfold`). Copy it, edit
it, and point `--config` at your own — the agent has no built-in engine names.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s agents/macos/tests
```

They reuse the SSH collector's macOS fixtures, so both transports are asserted to
produce the same unified-memory and powermetrics numbers from the same capture.

A reachable agent owns all system reads, including uptime and hardware metadata.
Missing fields remain unavailable; SSH fallback is used only when the agent
cannot supply a valid snapshot. The thermal-pressure row summarizes **last
recorded** pmset warnings, not a temperature sensor or a live Celsius reading.
